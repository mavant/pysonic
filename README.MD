Have you always wanted to try one of the Lisps, but been intimidated by the parentheses? Do you derive pleasure from meticulously indented code? Does the phrase "semantic whitespace" fill you with joy?

Well then, pythonic is for you!

Pythonic is currently a very simple Clojure macro that makes Lisp-family code look like Python code. It is eventually intended to be a usable alternate syntax, if I can figure out how to get around the lack of user-defined reader macros in clojure. 

Note that the transformation from the whitespace form back to S-expression form is not currently working.
