Have you always wanted to try one of the Lisps, but been intimidated by the parentheses? Do you derive pleasure from meticulously indented code? Does the phrase "dynamic whitespace" fill you with joy?

Pythonic is (currently) a very simple Clojure script that makes Lisp-family code look like Python code. Pythonic might stay this way forever, or might expand to be something more amusing. Who knows?
